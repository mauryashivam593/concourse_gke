Hi Team,

We are not able to install and update the gcc version from 5.4.0 to 7.5.0 in promote . 

Also we are not able to run the apt-get update command in promote which is giving the key expire error 
"W: An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/ Release: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1602869253  KEYEXPIRED 1602869253  KEYEXPIRED 1602869253"

Are you able to help on this issue ?

Thanks,
Shivam
